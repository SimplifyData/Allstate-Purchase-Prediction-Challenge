SCOPE OF WORK

DAY 1 - AUGUST 6TH, 2016 - SATURDAY: DONE!

WANDER AROUND THE DATA
    1) Project Start Date,
    2) General Exploration and Data Wander.

DAY 1 - RESULT:
The scope of work was complete by the deadline.
There were issues with, 
   1) Laptop wifi connection on Ubuntu 16LTS,
   3) Pycharm 2016.2 on both Ubuntu 16 LTS and Windows 10.  
   4) The Python Note was showing tiny when I ran it on Win 10 Mode with a 4K screen.

DAY 2 - AUGUST 7TH, 2016 - SUNDAY:
DONE!

PREPARATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1) Data Imputation- Getting rid of Null Values, 
2) Exploratory Analysis.

DAY 2 - RESULT:
Completed the day two milestone by the end of the deadline.
DAY 1 Issues Resolved:
1) Updated Ubuntu 16 LTS software.
2) Changed Java 9 to Java 8 for Pycharm 2016.2 (Ubuntu 16 LTS),
3) Cleared Cache out of the Pycharm and the Python Note Book,
4) The graphic card settings changed from Intel to exclusively Nvidia for stability (Ubuntu 16 LTS).
5) Nvidia card exclusive use is bringing stability to Pycharm and the text/code has become more legible.  

DAY 3 - AUGUST 8TH, 2016 - MONDAY:
IN PROGRESS... (Aug 9th, Aug 10th)

ADDING MORE COMMENTS TO THE PYTHON NOTEBOOK, PREPARING THE DATA FOR DISSECTION
1) Defining the comments and tags of the Python workbook,(Complete - Aug 8th)
2) Storing the Training Set into SQLITE DB, (In Progress - Aug 9th, Aug 10th)
3) Sorting out the data in the DB - Data Preparation. (In Progress- Aug 9th, Aug 10th)

DAY 3 - RESULT:
Task 1 complete, and started working on Task 2 but it was an end of the work day.
There was an issue:
1) The SQLITE column insertion algorithm was initially written using Order n. Several hours, 3-5 hours, were spent troubleshooting and rerunning. The problem was resolved by replacing the algorithm with a Constant Time Algorithm.

DAY 4 - AUGUST 9TH, 2016 - TUESDAY:
 In Progress... (Aug 10th)

MAKING SENSE OUT OF THE DATA TO SPEAK THE SCENARIO
1) Defining metrics by dissecting the data from the DB. (In Progress - Aug 10th)
2) Begin writing a report- Story Telling (In Progress- Aug 10th)
3) Detailed Story Telling and tieing down co-founding reasons for prediction.

DAY 4 - RESULT:
None of the tasks could be accomplished.
There was a constant issue with Ubuntu 16 and Pycharm 2016.2.
Purged Ubuntu 16 and installed Mint 18 for stability, and prepared the OS. Trying different versions of Pycharm, an issue with JSON loader for Jupyter. Uninstalled Anaconda 2-4.1.1 and installing 2-4.0.0, and installing Pycharm 2016.1 which supports Jupyter.
Problem Resolved -
System Stable :
    a) Mint 18 LTS Sarah - Cinnamon
    b) Pycharm 2016.1
    c) Anaconda 2-4.00 - updated matplot lib to 1.5.1
   d) Performed initial updates and setup for Mint 18 for stability.

DAY 5 - AUGUST 10TH, 2016 - WEDNESDAY:
PENDING...

MAKING SENSIBLE FORECASTING OF THE INSURANCE PACKAGES USING THE SORTED CASES
1) Since this is a publicly known project - I will study the detailed usage of random forest from Udacity from two classes:
        a) Intro to Machine Learning
        b) Machine Learning - Georgia Tech
2) Apply Random Forest to the applicable sets
3) Study the cases defined on DAY 4 and use different ML Models.

DAY 6 - AUGUST 11TH, 2016 - THURSDAY
PENDING...

DAY 5 CONTINUED -STUDYING AND APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES 
1) Study the cases defined on DAY 4 and DAY 5, and applicable  Machine Learning models to concatenate a forecasted result of the Insurance.

DAY 5-RESULTS:

DAY 6 - AUGUST 12, 2016 - FRIDAY
PENDING...

DERIVE THE FINAL RESULT OF THE INSURANCE PACKAGE PREDICTION
1) Combine all the pieces of puzzles together to produce a prediction.

DAY 6 - RESULT:

DAY 7 -AUGUST 13, 2016 - SATURDAY
PENDING...

PRESENT YOUR RESULTS AND ENGINEERING REPORT
1) Tidy up the work and any remaining pieces,
2) Final Report completion.
